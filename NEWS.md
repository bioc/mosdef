# mosdef 0.99.4

* Added persistent location to the script that generates the data objects

# mosdef 0.99.3

* Working on the size and time constraints for the vignette/package to build and check on the BBS

# mosdef 0.99.2

* Better specification of data objects format and location in the installed folder

# mosdef 0.99.1

* This version contains the newly implemented changes as a response to the Bioconductor review.
  In brief, this includes:
  - renaming the functions (and parameters) to a more consistent style
  - reduction of the dependencies and runtime of checks/tests
  - more details on the exported data objects, and on the outputs (detailed in the vignette)
  - better structure for the vignette with cross-references among sections
  - modularization of some functions to avoid repetitive code
  - implementation of an API which is already framework-agnostic, to later accommodate e.g. edgeR/limma.
    Mainly, this implies the renaming of the `dds` to a more generic `de_container`, whereas the `res_de`
    parameter stays constant.
